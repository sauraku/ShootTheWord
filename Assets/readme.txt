Assumptions and diversions::
1). instead of making three colored button. i put an animation on play button.
    it'll keep changing color and based on the color it had when clicked,  
    gameround background will be changed.
2). to destroy the letter we will be using mouse click.
3). there is also a tuff gameround level in which the letters are falling 
    sort of independently.




:: all the assets are self generated or (royality free) downloaded (except for words.txt).::
:: words.txt is a file of words google provided us at android workshop. not sure i should have used it or not.::

overall time that i would have spent on this game is about 5-6 hours.

p.s. - i had 8 deadlines (including this) and one upcoming exam at the time of this offline assignment
        so i was unable to give time on assets creation.
